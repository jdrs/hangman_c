HANGMAN v0.4

Hangman written in C.

---------
  BUILD
---------

Linux:

Simply issue 'make' from top-level directory to build.

Windows:

I have never tried compiling on a Windows platform. I do cross-compilation to
get Windows binaries.

To cross-compile you need:
    mingw-w64

Run 'make win32' from top-level directory to build Windows binaries.
